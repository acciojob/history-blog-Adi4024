    <h1>History</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><b>Main articles:</b> History of blogging and online diary. 
        An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time 
        from a wearable computer was started by Steve Mann, who began "weblogging" as early as December 17, 1994.
        The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog 
        in the sidebar of his blog, Peterme.com in April or May 1999.

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>
        Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, 
        Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).
